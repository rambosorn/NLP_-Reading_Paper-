Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf

### Introduction
A new language representation model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text data by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using two novel unsupervised prediction tasks, including masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. The pre-trained BERT model can then be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks. The experimental results show that BERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training deep bidirectional representations.

|Problem| Standard self-attention mechanisms may not effectively capture contextual information, leading to reduced performance on certain natural language processing tasks.   |
|Related Work| Existing work in self-attention mechanisms and contextual modeling, such as the Transformer model and the ELMo model.|
|Objective| They introduce the Context-Aware Self-Attention (CASA) Network, which incorporates contextual information into the self-attention mechanism to improve performance on natural language processing tasks.|
|Result|help the model better capture the relationship between the context of a word and the sentiment expressed by the word.|
| |By weighting each word in the input sequence based on its context, the model is able to focus on the most important words in the sequence for the sentiment analysis task.|
| |proposed model outperforms several baseline models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results and also perform the effectiveness of the context-aware attention mechanism.|
|Limitation| They acknowledges that the proposed model may not be suitable for all natural language processing tasks, and that there may be limitations to the approach in terms of computational complexity.|

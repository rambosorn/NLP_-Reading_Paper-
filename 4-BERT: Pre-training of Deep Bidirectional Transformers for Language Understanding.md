Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf

### Introduction
A new language representation model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text data by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using two novel unsupervised prediction tasks, including masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. The pre-trained BERT model can then be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks. The experimental results show that BERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training deep bidirectional representations.

|Problem| presents the problem of improving the performance of NLP tasks by pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. It discusses the challenges of designing a model that can effectively capture dependencies between different parts of a sentence and can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks without substantial architecture modifications. |
|Related Work| The paper starts by discussing the previous pre-training methods for language representation models, including the word embedding-based methods and the context-based methods. It highlights the limitations of these methods, such as their inability to capture long-range dependencies and their reliance on left or right context.|
|Result|concludes by summarizing the results and highlighting the improvements achieved by BERT over previous state-of-the-art models. It also discusses the limitations of BERT, such as its high computational cost and the need for large amounts of unlabeled data for pre-training. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for research in language representation models and the potential applications of BERT in real-world NLP tasks.|

# BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf

### Introduction
A new language representation model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.

|Topic| BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understan |
|Problem| Standard self-attention mechanisms may not effectively capture contextual information, leading to reduced performance on certain natural language processing tasks.   |
|Related Work| Existing work in self-attention mechanisms and contextual modeling, such as the Transformer model and the ELMo model.|
|Objective| They introduce the Context-Aware Self-Attention (CASA) Network, which incorporates contextual information into the self-attention mechanism to improve performance on natural language processing tasks.|
|Result|help the model better capture the relationship between the context of a word and the sentiment expressed by the word.|
| |By weighting each word in the input sequence based on its context, the model is able to focus on the most important words in the sequence for the sentiment analysis task.|
| |proposed model outperforms several baseline models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results and also perform the effectiveness of the context-aware attention mechanism.|
|Limitation| They acknowledges that the proposed model may not be suitable for all natural language processing tasks, and that there may be limitations to the approach in terms of computational complexity.|

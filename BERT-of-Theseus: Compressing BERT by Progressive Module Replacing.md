| Topic |BERT-of-Theseus: Compressing BERT by Progressive Module Replacing |
| Problem | 1. The size and computational cost of large language models like BERT are challenging to handle, especially when deploying in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or edge computing systems.|
|  |2. The challenge of reducing the size and computational cost of large language models while maintaining their accuracy and ability to generalize to new data.|
|  |3. The need for a method that balances the trade-off between model size and accuracy, making it possible to deploy large language models in resource-constrained environments while maintaining their performance. |
| Objective | Proposing a method for compressing BERT through the use of progressive module replacing, which allows for reducing the size of the model while maintaining its accuracy and performance on various natural language processing tasks. The authors aim to find a balance between model size and accuracy, making it possible to deploy large language models in resource-constrained environments while maintaining their performance.|
| Limitation | Stanza not being state-of-the-art in every NLP task, limited language coverage, high computational resource requirements, and potential performance issues with small or domain-specific data. |
| Result | Show strong performance in NLP tasks, including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and text classification. The pre-trained models have strong language coverage and the toolkit's architecture is flexible and easily customizable. |
| Conclusion and Future work | Focus on improving performance, expanding language coverage, optimizing resource efficiency, and developing advanced models for specific tasks. The authors believe Stanza is a significant step forward in NLP research and toolkit development. |

### Set Up Environment
To install the Stanza library in your Python environment, you can run the following command:

pip install stanza

To set up the environment and download necessary models, use the following code:

 import stanza
 stanza.download("en")
 nlp = stanza.Pipeline("en")

This will download the English models and set up a pipeline to process text in English. You can replace "en" with any other supported language code to process text in a different language.
